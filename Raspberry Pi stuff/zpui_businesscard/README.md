# ZPUI businesscard

## Are you here from the link on the businesscard?

The assembly should be pretty easy - as long as you have 8 buttons of the simplest kind, an generic 4-pin I2C OLED screen,
and a pin header to connect this to a Pi, it should work wonders. It's designed to work with [ZPUI](https://zpui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - 
"making this card work" software updates are to be pushed imminently!
